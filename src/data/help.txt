<<Documentation of git add>>
    Updates the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next
    commit. It typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but with some options it can also be used to add
    content with only part of the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths that do not exist in the working
    tree anymore.

    The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the
    next commit. Thus after making any changes to the working directory, and before running the commit command, you must use the add
    command to add any new or modified files to the index.

    This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the
    add command is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit, then you must run git add again to add the new
    content to the index.

    <pathspec>...
           Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g.  *.c) can be given to add all matching files. Also a leading directory name (e.g.
           dir to add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to update the index to match the current state of the directory as a whole
           (e.g. specifying dir will record not just a file dir/file1 modified in the working tree, a file dir/file2 added to the
           working tree, but also a file dir/file3 removed from the working tree. Note that older versions of Git used to ignore removed
           files; use --no-all option if you want to add modified or new files but ignore removed ones.

    --force
          Allow adding otherwise ignored files.

    --update
          Update the index just where it already has an entry matching <pathspec>. This removes as well as modifies index entries to
          match the working tree, but adds no new files.

          If no <pathspec> is given when -u option is used, all tracked files in the entire working tree are updated (old versions of
          Git used to limit the update to the current directory and its subdirectories).

    --all
          Update the index not only where the working tree has a file matching <pathspec> but also where the index already has an
          entry. This adds, modifies, and removes index entries to match the working tree.

          If no <pathspec> is given when -A option is used, all files in the entire working tree are updated (old versions of Git used
          to limit the update to the current directory and its subdirectories).

    --ignore-errors
          If some files could not be added because of errors indexing them, do not abort the operation, but continue adding the others.
          The command shall still exit with non-zero status. The configuration variable add.ignoreErrors can be set to true to make
          this the default behaviour.
##

<<Documentation of git branch(create)>>
    Creates a new branch head named <branchname> which points to the current HEAD, or <start-point> if given.

    Note that this will create the new branch, but it will not switch the working tree to it; use "git checkout <newbranch>" to
    switch to the new branch.

    When a local branch is started off a remote-tracking branch, Git sets up the branch (specifically the branch.<name>.remote and
    \branch.<name>.merge configuration entries) so that git pull will appropriately merge from the remote-tracking branch.
##

<<Documentation of git branch(delete)>>
   With a -d or -D option, <branchname> will be deleted. You may specify more than one branch for
   deletion.
##

<<Documentation of git branch(rename)>>
  With a -m or -M option, <oldbranch> will be renamed to <newbranch>.
##

<<Documentation of git checkout>>
  Updates files in the working tree to match the version in the index or the specified tree. If
  no paths are given, git checkout will also update HEAD to set the specified branch as the
  current branch.

  git checkout <branch>
    To prepare for working on <branch>, switch to it by updating the index and the files in
    the working tree, and by pointing HEAD at the branch. Local modifications to the files in
    the working tree are kept, so that they can be committed to the <branch>.

  git checkout [-p|--patch] [<tree-ish>] [--] <pathspec>...
    When <paths> or --patch are given, git checkout does not switch branches. It updates the
    named paths in the working tree from the index file or from a named <tree-ish> (most often
    a commit).
##

<<Documentation of git clone>>
  Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates remote-tracking branches for each
  branch in the cloned repository (visible using git branch -r), and creates and checks out an
  initial branch that is forked from the cloned repository’s currently active branch.

  After the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments will update all the remote-tracking
  branches, and a git pull without arguments will in addition merge the remote master branch
  into the current master branch

  <repository>
           The (possibly remote) repository to clone from. See the URLS section below for more
           information on specifying repositories.

  <directory>
           The name of a new directory to clone into. The "humanish" part of the source repository is
           used if no directory is explicitly given (repo for /path/to/repo.git and foo for
           host.xz:foo/.git). Cloning into an existing directory is only allowed if the directory is
           empty.
##

<<Documentation of git commit>>
  Stores the current contents of the index in a new commit along with a log message from the
  user describing the changes.

  -m <msg>, --message=<msg>
           Use the given <msg> as the commit message.

  <file>...
          When files are given on the command line, the command commits the contents of the named
          files, without recording the changes already staged. The contents of these files are also
          staged for the next commit on top of what have been staged before.

  -a, --all
          Tell the command to automatically stage files that have been modified and deleted, but new
          files you have not told Git about are not affected.
  --amend
          Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit. The recorded tree is
          prepared as usual, and the message from the original commit is used as the starting point,
          instead of an empty message, when no other message is specified from the command line. The
          new commit has the same parents and author as the current one
##

<<Documentation of fetch>>
  Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or more other repositories, along
  with the objects necessary to complete their histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated.

  When no remote is specified, by default the origin remote will be used, unless there’s an
  upstream branch configured for the current branch.

  The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as <repository> argument:

      ·   a remote in the Git configuration file: $GIT_DIR/config,

      ·   a file in the $GIT_DIR/remotes directory, or

      ·   a file in the $GIT_DIR/branches directory.

      All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line because they each
      contain a refspec which git will use by default.
##

<<Documentation of init>>
  This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a .git directory with subdirectories
  for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags, and template files. An initial HEAD file that references
  the HEAD of the master branch is also created.

  Running git init in an existing repository is safe. It will not overwrite things that are
  already there.

  --bare
           Create a bare repository. If GIT_DIR environment is not set, it is set to the current
           working directory.
##

<<Documentation of merge>>
      Incorporates changes from the named commits (since the time their histories diverged from the
      current branch) into the current branch. This command is used by git pull to incorporate
      changes from another repository and can be used by hand to merge changes from one branch into
      another.

      Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "master":

                    A---B---C topic
                   /
              D---E---F---G master

      Then "git merge topic" will replay the changes made on the topic branch since it diverged from
      master (i.e., E) until its current commit (C) on top of master, and record the result in a new
      commit along with the names of the two parent commits and a log message from the user
      describing the changes.

                    A---B---C topic
                   /         \
              D---E---F---G---H master

      <branch>...
        Branch to merge into our branch.

      <commit>...
          Commits, usually other branch heads, to merge into our branch. Specifying more than one
          commit will create a merge with more than two parents (affectionately called an Octopus
          merge).

          If no commit is given from the command line, merge the remote-tracking branches that the
          current branch is configured to use as its upstream.
##

<<Documentation of pull>>
       Incorporates changes from a remote repository into the current branch. In its default mode,
       git pull is shorthand for git fetch followed by git merge FETCH_HEAD.

       More precisely, git pull runs git fetch with the given parameters and calls git merge to merge
       the retrieved branch heads into the current branch.

       <repository>
           The "remote" repository that is the source of a fetch or pull operation. This parameter
           can be either a URL or the name of a remote.

      <refspec>
          Specifies which refs to fetch and which local refs to update. When no <refspec>s appear on
          the command line, the refs to fetch are read from remote.<repository>.fetch variables
          instead.

          The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus +, followed by the source ref
          <src>, followed by a colon :, followed by the destination ref <dst>. The colon can be
          omitted when <dst> is empty.
##

<<Documentation of push>>
       Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary to complete the given
       refs.

       When the command line does not specify where to push with the <repository> argument,
       branch.*.remote configuration for the current branch is consulted to determine where to push.
       If the configuration is missing, it defaults to origin.

       <repository>
          The "remote" repository that is destination of a push operation. This parameter can be
          either a URL or the name of a remote.

      <refspec>...
          Specify what destination ref to update with what source object. The format of a <refspec>
          parameter is an optional plus +, followed by the source object <src>, followed by a colon
          :, followed by the destination ref <dst>.

          The <src> is often the name of the branch you would want to push.
##

<<Documentation of reset>>
     In the first and second form, copy entries from <tree-ish> to the index. In the third form,
     set the current branch head (HEAD) to <commit>, optionally modifying index and working tree to
     match. The <tree-ish>/<commit> defaults to HEAD in all forms.

     git reset [-q] [<tree-ish>] [--] <paths>...
           This form resets the index entries for all <paths> to their state at <tree-ish>. (It does
           not affect the working tree or the current branch.)

           This means that git reset <paths> is the opposite of git add <paths>.

           After running git reset <paths> to update the index entry, you can use git-checkout(1) to
           check the contents out of the index to the working tree. Alternatively, using git-
           checkout(1) and specifying a commit, you can copy the contents of a path out of a commit
           to the index and to the working tree in one go.

    git reset (--patch | -p) [<tree-ish>] [--] [<paths>...]
                Interactively select hunks in the difference between the index and <tree-ish> (defaults to
                HEAD). The chosen hunks are applied in reverse to the index.

                This means that git reset -p is the opposite of git add -p, i.e. you can use it to
                selectively reset hunks. See the “Interactive Mode” section of git-add(1) to learn how to
                operate the --patch mode.

    git reset [<mode>] [<commit>]
                This form resets the current branch head to <commit> and possibly updates the index
                (resetting it to the tree of <commit>) and the working tree depending on <mode>. If <mode>
                is omitted, defaults to "--mixed". The <mode> must be one of the following:
##

<<Documentation of git rm>>
     Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git rm will not remove a
     file from just your working directory.

     <file>...
          Files to remove. Fileglobs (e.g.  *.c) can be given to remove all matching files. If you
          want Git to expand file glob characters, you may need to shell-escape them. A leading
          directory name (e.g.  dir to remove dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to remove all
          files in the directory, and recursively all sub-directories, but this requires the -r
          option to be explicitly given.

      -f, --force
          Override the up-to-date check.

      -r
          Allow recursive removal when a leading directory name is given.

      --cached
          Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index. Working tree files,
          whether modified or not, will be left alone.
